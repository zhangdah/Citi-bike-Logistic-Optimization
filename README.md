# CitiBike Station Usage Analysis Using Markov Chains

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing CitiBike station usage in New York City using discrete Markov chains. By studying the in-and-out patterns of three major stations, we aim to predict the availability of bikes and optimize station management.

## Data Source
Ride data from CitiBike, New York City, July 2023.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Filtering out abnormal ride durations.
2. **Station Selection:** Analyzing ride data to select the top three busiest stations.
3. **Discrete Markov Chain Application:** Using Markov chains to simulate bike availability at each station during peak hours.
4. **Probability Distribution:** Establishing the probability distribution of bike number changes.
5. **Transition Matrix Construction:** Formulating the transition matrix for each station based on bike number change probabilities.
6. **Stationary Distribution Calculation:** Determining the long-term distribution of bikes at each station.

## Results
- Stationary distribution plots and expected bike availability for each station during morning and afternoon periods.
- Insights on bike utilization dynamics at selected stations.
- Suggestions for bike redistribution and station management strategies.

## Discussion
- Analyzing patterns at each station and their implications on urban mobility.
- Limitations and future research directions.

## Conclusion
The study provides valuable insights into the usage patterns of key CitiBike stations, aiding in the development of efficient bike logistics management strategies.
